# Hi, I'm Mathew! ðŸ‘‹
## About me...
**Name:** Mathew Wingerson (he/him)\
**Location:** Denver, CO (relocating to... tbd)\
**Job:** PhD Student in Rehabilitation Sciences with focus in Data Sciences and Health Analytics\
**Company:** University of Colorado School of Medicine | [Colorado Concussion Research Laboratory](https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/orthopedics/research/labs/howell-concussion-lab)\
**Education:**
> **Doctor of Philosophy** (expected 2026) | University of Colorado School of Medicine
>> Focus: Data Sciences and Health Analytics\
>> Focus: Rehabilitation Sciences (study of disease progresion/treatment)

> **Certificate in Data Science and Health Analytics** (expected 2025) | University of Colorado School of Medicine
>> Focus: Multi-layer perceptron networks (feed forward)\
>> Focus: Recurrent neural networks\
        
## Motivation...
I'm passionate about the process of using information to generate predictions and make decisions! I have a strong background in the applied mathematics supporting modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems.\ 

## What I am learning now...
> Multi-layer perceptrons
>> Predicting cancer development from omics data\
>> Predicting non-resolving mental health symptoms in adolescents with concussion\

> Convolutional networks
>> Identifying lession types from medical imaging\
>> Predicting age from facial features\

> Recurrent networks
>> Predicting symptom progression using wearable physical activity and sleep data during concussion recovery

## Project's I've worked on...
> Near-infrared spectroscopy for identifying cerebrovascualr impairment in adolescents with concussion
>> Quantifying cerebrovascular dysfunction using advanced medical technology\

> Isotemportal substituion modeling of wearable activity tracking
>> Time-based (i.e., temporal) modeling of activity behaviors and their effect on post-concussion symptom resolution\

> Structural equation modeling of longitudinal data
>> Sleep and exercise: Longitudinal assocations throughout recovery from concussion\

> Longitudinal analysis of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
>> Neurometabolite concentrations predict physical activity volumes after concussion\

> Random forests
>> Predicting non-resolving mental health disturbance after concussion using diverse clinical data\
