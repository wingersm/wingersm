## Motivation...
I'm passionate about the process of using information to generate predictions and make decisions! I have a strong background in the applied mathematics supporting modern machine learning and deep learning architectures, and I enjoy using that knowledge to solve real-world problems.\ 

## What I am learning now...
> Multi-layer perceptrons
>> Predicting cancer development from omics data\
>> Predicting non-resolving mental health symptoms in adolescents with concussion\

> Convolutional networks
>> Identifying lession types from skin images\
>> Predicting age from face images\

> Recurrent networks
>> Predicting symptom progression from wearable physical activity and sleep information during concussion recovery
